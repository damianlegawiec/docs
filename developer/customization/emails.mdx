# Emails

{% hint style="info" %}
Emails are now part of `spree_emails` gem
{% endhint %}

## Overview

Spree uses [postmark templates](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-templates), as a base for all transactional emails.

## Email previews

Spree offers an emails preview generator for development purposes. To generate them, use the command:

```bash
bundle exec rails g spree:emails:install
```

After that, start the rails server locally and go to: `localhost:3000/rails/mailers`

(it requires a seeded development database in order to work properly)
