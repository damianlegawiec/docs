# 4.4 to 4.5

**If you're on an older version than 4.4 please follow previous upgrade guides and perform those upgrades incrementally**, eg.

1. [upgrade 4.1 to 4.2](four-dot-one-to-four-dot-two.md)
2. [upgrade 4.2 to 4.3](fout-dot-two-to-four-dot-three.md)
3. [upgrade 4.3 to 4.4](https://dev-docs.spreecommerce.org/upgrades/upgrades/4.3-to-4.4)

This is the safest and recommended method.

## Upgrade Rails

Rails 6.0 is no longer supported - if you haven’t already, you’ll need to upgrade to **Rails 6.1 or 7.0**. The effort to upgrade to Rails 6.1 is relatively low, but brings a lot of improvements around ActiveStorage and handling of CDNs. See the Rails docs [for upgrading from 6.0 to 6.1](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading\_ruby\_on\_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-6-0-to-rails-6-1), and for [upgrading from 6.1 to 7.0](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading\_ruby\_on\_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-6-1-to-rails-7-0).

If using Rails 7, you will need to [install libvips](https://www.libvips.org/install.html) on your cloud environment, as Rails 7 uses vips as its default variant processor. You can still use imagemagick, but you’ll need to manually set it in your [Rails config](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveStorage/Variant.html).

## Update Spree Config

If you're upgrading your app to Rails 7, you'll need to make a slight update to your spree config initializer. In `config/initializers/spree.rb`, wrap the `Spree.config` block in a `Rails.application.config.after_initialize` block, like so:

```
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Spree.config do |config|
    # config settings initialized here
  end
end
```

If you don't perform this update to the code, you may expect to get the following error:

```shell
/lib/spree/core/preferences/store.rb:96:in `should_persist?': 
uninitialized constant Spree::Preference (NameError)
```

## Update other initializers

Just like with Spree::Config, you may need to [update other intializers in your application, that use autoloadable constants](https://rubyonrails.org/2021/9/3/autoloading-in-rails-7-get-ready).

For example, if you use `spree_auth_devise`, you'll need to update `config/initializers/devise.rb` and wrap the configuration in `Rails.application.config.after_initialize` block:

```
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  if defined?(Spree::Auth)
    Spree::Auth::Config.signout_after_password_change = false
  end
end
```

## Update Gemfile

```
gem 'spree', '>= 4.5.0'
```

Update all other spree gems used in your application to 4.5.0 or version compatible with 4.5:

```
gem 'spree_sample', '~> 4.5.0'
gem 'spree_emails', '~> 4.5.0'
gem 'spree_frontend', '>= 4.5.0'
gem 'spree_backend', '>= 4.5.0'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.10'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '>= 4.5.0'
gem 'spree_i18n', '~> 5.1'
```

If your application depends on the Spree v1 API, you'll have to include it as a gem, as it has been extracted from the spree gem:

```
gem 'spree_api_v1'
```

## Update gems

```bash
bundle update
```

## Install missing migrations

```bash
bin/rake railties:install:migrations
```

## Run migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Run Additional Commands for Frontend

If using [Spree Frontend](https://github.com/spree/spree\_legacy\_frontend), run the following additional commands to get everything set up correctly with the updated gems:

```
bin/rails javascript:install:esbuild
bin/rails turbo:install
bin/rails g spree:frontend:install
yarn build
```

And that's a wrap! :tada:
