# 4.6 to 4.7

**If you're on an older version than 4.6 please follow previous upgrade guides and perform those upgrades incrementally, e.g.**

1. [upgrade 4.3 to 4.4](https://dev-docs.spreecommerce.org/upgrades/upgrades/4.3-to-4.4)
2. [upgrade 4.4 to 4.5](4.4-to-4.5.md)
3. [upgrade 4.5 to 4.6](4.5-to-4.6.md)

This is the safest and recommended method.

## Update Gemfile

```
gem 'spree', '~> 4.7.0'
```

Update all other spree gems used in your application to 4.7.0 or version compatible with 4.7:

```
gem 'spree_sample', '~> 4.7.0'
gem 'spree_emails', '~> 4.7.0'
gem 'spree_backend', '~> 4.7.0'
gem 'spree_frontend', '~> 4.7.0'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.10.0'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 4.6.0'
gem 'spree_i18n', '~> 5.3.0'
```



{% hint style="warning" %}
If your Gemfile includes spree\_frontend, make sure it's defined below spree\_backend. This is required for a proper initialization of the admin action buttons defined by spree\_frontend.
{% endhint %}

## (Optional) Upgrade to Rails 7.1

Spree 4.7 brings support for Rails 7.1 - to receive security patches we recommend upgrading Rails version to the latest one.

```
gem 'rails', '~> 7.1.0'
```

After upgrading to Rails 7.1, you may need to update your code to be compatible with the new release of Rails. Follow the official [Rails 7.1 Release Notes](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/7\_1\_release\_notes.html) for more information on new features introduced in that release as well as on breaking changes.

## Update gems

```bash
bundle update
```

## Install missing migrations

```bash
bin/rake railties:install:migrations
```

## Run migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Run Additional Commands for Frontend

If using [Spree Frontend](https://github.com/spree/spree\_legacy\_frontend), run the following additional commands to get everything set up correctly with the updated gems:

```
bin/rails javascript:install:esbuild
bin/rails turbo:install
bin/rails g spree:frontend:install
yarn build
```

And that's a wrap! :tada:
